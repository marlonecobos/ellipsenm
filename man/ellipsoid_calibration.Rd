\usage{
ellipsoid_calibration(data, species, longitude, latitude, variables,
                      format_in = NULL, methods, level = 95,
                      selection_criteria = "S_OR_P", error = 5,
                      iterations = 500, percentage = 50,
                      parallel = FALSE, overwrite = FALSE,
                      output_directory = "calibration_results")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(character or list) if character, vector of names of csv files
containing all, training, and testing occurrences located in the working
directory; if list, object resulted from \code{\link{split_data}}. Columns of
tables must include: species, longitude, and latitude.}

\item{species}{(character) name of the column with the name of the species.}

\item{longitude}{(character) name of the column with longitude data.}

\item{latitude}{(character) name of the column with latitude data.}

\item{variables}{(character or list) if character, name of a folder containing
subfolders of at least one set of variables; if list, object derived from
\code{\link{prepare_sets}}. Sets of variables must contain at least two layers.}

\item{format_in}{(character) if \code{variables} is character, format of the
variables found in folders. Default = NULL.}

\item{methods}{(character) methods to construct the ellipsoid ecological niche
models to be tested. Available methods are: "covmat", "mve1", and "mve2".
See details of \code{\link{ellipsoid_fit}}.}

\item{level}{(numeric) the confidence level of a pairwise confidence region
for the ellipsoid, expresed as percentage. Default = 95.}

\item{selection_criteria}{(character) set of criteria to select best models,
options are: "S_OR" (statistical significance and low omission) and
"S_OR_P" (statistical significance, low omission, and low prevalence).
See details. Default = "S_OR_P".}

\item{error}{(numeric) value from 0 to 100 to represent the percentage of
potential error (E) that the data could have due to any source of uncertainty.
Default = 5.}

\item{iterations}{(numeric) number of bootstrap iterations to be performed;
default = 500.}

\item{percentage}{(numeric) percentage of testing data to be used in each
bootstrapped process for calculating the partial ROC. Default = 50.}

\item{parallel}{(logical) whether or not to run analyses in parallel. If
defined as TRUE, it will only run in parallel if the number of parameter
settings to be tested is equal or larger than the number of cores available.}

\item{overwrite}{(logical) whether or not to overwrite exitent results in
\code{output_directory}. Default = FALSE.}

\item{output_directory}{(character) name of the folder were results of model
calibration and selection will be written.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{calibration_ellipsoid}} with all
results and details derived from the calibration process. A folder named
\code{output_directory}, containing all results as well as a detailed HTML
report will also be created.
}
\description{
ellipsoid_calibration helps in creating and evaluating multiple
candidate ellipsoid envelop models to find parameter settings that produce
the best results.
}
\details{
Statistical significance is assessed using the partial_ROC test, omission
rates refer to the proportion of testing data known to be in suitable areas
but predicted as unsuitable, and prevalence is the proportion of geographic
and environmental space predicted as suitable.

The maximum expected omission rates are 1 - (\code{level} / 100). Thus, if
\code{level} is determined as 95, an adequate omission rate should not be
higher than 0.5.

Good models are expected to have low omission rates and low prevalence. This
implies that the model is predicting correctly in smaller areas.
